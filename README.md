# Java
### Java Programming Language
- Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms.
- Java is fast, reliable, and secure.
-  Java is used in every nook and corner from desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet.
### Steps to Implement Java Program
1. Creating the program
2. Compiling the program
3. Running the program
### Data Types
- Data types in Java are of different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable that is made as per convenience and circumstances to cover up all test cases.
- Java has two categories in which data types are segregated
  - **Primitive Data Type:** such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double. The Boolean with uppercase B is a wrapper class for the primitive data type boolean in Java.
  - **Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type:** such as String, Array, Class, Object, Interfaces, enum  etc. <br>

#### Primitive Data Types
- A primitive data type specifies the type of a variable and the kind of values it can hold.
- **Integer types** stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are `byte`, `short`, `int` and `long`.
- **Floating point types** represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: `float` and `double`.
